# Module-Prediction-Desease-plante-or-helthy
It is a model that is concerned with examining and diagnosing the plant and concluding whether the plant is diseased or healthy. We trained the model on two plants: the tomato plant, which has 8 diseases, by giving it images and 1 file containing healthy images. Also, with the rice plant, there are 4 files with diseases and 1 healthy one.
